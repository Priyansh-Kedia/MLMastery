# Time series datasets may contain trends and seasonality, which 
# may need to be removed prior to modeling.

# Trends can result in a varying mean over time, whereas seasonality 
# can result in a changing variance over time, both which define a 
# time series as being non-stationary. Stationary datasets are those 
# that have a stable mean and variance, and are in turn much easier to model.
